## Description:
Spawner Blocker is a lightweight mod designed to simplify the gameplay. It disables spawner functionality while still granting XP upon destruction, preventing them to be completely useless. This is made for players who prefer a cleaner singleplayer experience or who find custom maps cluttered with too many spawners.

Key features:

- Disables all mob spawners to prevent automatic farming and mob abuse.

- Grants XP instantly when breaking a spawner, preserving part of its original value.

- Lightweight and fully compatible with most other mods.

Whether you're playing in a singleplayer world or managing your server, SPawner Blocker helps streamline gameplay while maintaining balance and fairness.

This mod has full compatibility with most mods that introduce new spawners or alter existing ones.

I will soon release this mod for additional Minecraft versions. To stay up to date for future updates and releases, consider following this mod!
